// ConVars for plugin "abm.smx"


// 0: Off 1: Non-Vs > 4 2: Non-Vs >= 1
// -
// Default: "1"
// If greater than or equal to 1, (abm_spawninterval x 5) will match a full wave of SI to the size of the surviving team. Half this value will match half the size of the surviving team. SI waves only spawn in non-competitive modes. See abm_unlocksi for spawning more SI in competitive modes.
abm_autohard "0"

// 1: Full set of survivors 0: Map set of survivors
// -
// Default: "1"
// Try to automatically model survivors to as unique a set as possible. This includes L4D1 characters on an L4D2 map and vice versa. Give this a value of 0 to turn it off.
abm_automodel "1"

// 5+ survivor consumable item
// -
// Default: "adrenaline"
abm_consumable 0

// Extra survivors to start the round with
// -
// Default: "0"
// This many extra survivors are added spawned in at the start of every round. If this is set to 4 and abm_minplayers is also set to 4, you'll get a total of 8 players at the start of the round.
abm_extraplayers "0"

// 5+ survivor healing item
// -
// Default: "" weapon_first_aid_kit
abm_healitem ""

// 0: Do not assign identities 1: Assign identities
// -
// Default: "1"
// Try to remember and restore a survivor (real client, not bot) character. In some situations a survivor may change identity and ABM will try to fix that. If you're purposefully changing characters outside of ABM or wish to disable this, a value of 0 will turn this off.
abm_identityfix "0"

// 0: Off 1: Admins only 2: Everyone
// -
// Default: "1"
// When set to 0, players joining will automatically be put onto a team. When set to 1 only admins will join in as spectators and be offered an option to join idler, spectator, survivor or infected. When set to 2, non-admins will join in as spectators and be able to choose from idler, spectator or survivor.
abm_joinmenu "0"

// 0: The dead return alive 1: the dead return dead
// -
// Default: "0"
// New survivor bots are created for new players and some people that may die may leave and rejoin to take advantage of it. Turning this to 1 will try to prevent that in making sure that players that leave and return, return dead.
abm_keepdead "0"

// Development logging level 0: Off, 4: Max
// -
// Default: "0"
// When set to 1 or greater (up to 4 for increased verbosity) will show you the calls ABM makes. This isn't useful for figuring out any random crashes but helps when developing a feature or for figuring out a reliable and repeatable problem.
abm_loglevel "0"

// Pruning extra survivors stops at this size
// -
// Default: "4"
// On the start of every round and during play, survivors are pruned to match this value (includes abm_extraplayers). If you set this to 2, every round will start off with only 2 survivors. When extra players join in and then leave, pruning of survivors will continue until this value (and abm_extraplayers) is matched.
abm_minplayers "4"

// 0: Off 1: Survivors 2: Infected 3: All
// -
// Default: "1"
// When set to 0 this will be turned off. When set to 1 (for survivors) or 2 (for infected), players will be offered a takeover menu (only if a bot is available) upon their death. Setting this to 3, everyone will get a takeover menu on death. This can get noisy for people on SI and may even cause confusion or death.
abm_offertakeover "0"

// 5+ survivor primary weapon
// -
// Default: "shotgun_chrome"
abm_primaryweapon "weapon_smg_silenced"

// 5+ survivor secondary weapon

abm_spawninterval "36"

// 0: Don't strip removed bots 1: Strip removed bots
// -
// Default: "0"
// This will not strip leaving survivors of their inventory and all of their items will drop to the floor where they leave the game. Turning this to 1 will strip leaving survivors of all of their inventory and nothing will drop.
abm_stripkick "0"

// Health chunk per survivor on 5+ missions
// -
// Default: "2500"
// Tank's health multiplied per survivor. Setting this to 0 will turn this enhancement off. This cvar also depends on abm_autohard being greater than or equal to 1. If abm_autohard is set to 1, Tank's health is only modified when the surviving team size is greater than 4. If abm_autohard is set to 2, Tank's health will always be modified based on this value. Important to note is 2500 is based on Normal difficulty. This is cut in half on easy, multiplied 1.5x on Advance and multiplied by 2x on Expert.
abm_tankchunkhp "1500"

// Humans on team limit
// -
// Default: "16"
// This sets a limit of humans allowed on any given playable team. Only new players joining the server will automatically get moved to spectator if the humans on team have already met this limit. If you're having a match that requires teams be of a certain size, setting this will move those extra players onto spectator.
abm_teamlimit "4"

// -
// Default: ""
abm_throwable ""

// -
// Default: "0"
// With this value at 0, ABM will not be able to unlock SI in some situations (e.g., Versus). Changing this to 1 will unlock SI with the use of Left 4 Downtown 2 and with a value of 2 will use VScript Director Options Unlocker. Any value greater than 0 here should have its respective plugin already on the server.
abm_unlocksi "0"

// ABM plugin version
// -
// Default: "0.1.95"
abm_version "0.1.95"

// 0:Nick 1:Rochelle 2:Coach 3:Ellis 4:Bill 5:Zoey 6:Francis 7:Louis
// -
// Default: "5"
// Due to a bug on Windows, spawning in a Zoey can crash the server. This value is auto detected and set to 5 on Linux and 1 on Windows by default. You'll get the model Zoey in all cases but only on Windows will Zoey really be Rochelle or the model you decide on.
abm_zoey "5"
